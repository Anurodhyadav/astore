         Every store owner's dreams of having large number of customer.To achieve that at a higher level(To have millions of sales) it is extremly important to craft a website
         specifically that can target large number of audience.The internet has evolved over the decades. As it has, so has one aspect of the mobile app market: e-commerce.

     </p>
     <p>
        For the analysis, I looked at some well-known and successfull e-commerce site across the web to discover their common traits and best practices so that I can learn from them and gain valuable insights you can incorporate into my own site
     </p>
     <p>
         <h1 id="p1" class="myheading">1. Homepage design and content</h1>
     </p>
     <p>
        The homepage is the most important page of the site. It’s typically the most visited page and also the page the majority of customers land on before diving deeper into e-commerce site. For those reasons, a great homepage is both a valuable sales tool and a great opportunity to showcase the brand. Since the average customer makes a decision about the brand within 15 seconds of landing on the homepage, it’s more important than ever to get the homepage right.
     </p>
     <p>
         For an illustration we take a look at one of most popular e-commerce site <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>
     </p>
     <div class="text-center">
     <img id='econimages' src="images/ecom.png">
     </div>
     <p>
        <i>Amazon has a well-organized homepage. Their main promotion and graphic tells you exactly what you can expect to find on their site. They have grid layout of product enabling  quick access to products and popular categories to get customers shopping.</i>
     </p>
     <h1 id='p2' class="myheading">2. Mobile-Friendly </h1>
     <p>
        As e-commerce has changed, so has the way people sell products, do promotions, and influence or attract customers. On the other hand, buyers see products with new perspectives and the way they shop is changing.
     </p>
     <p>
        Shopping from desktops declined to just 55% from 60% compared with the previous year, and 2015 saw an exponential increase of mobile users.
     </p>
     <p>
        With nearly half of all shoppers shopping on mobile devices, having a mobile version of your site is almost mandatory. Having a mobile site impacts just about everything from user experience and conversion to sales and SEO.
     </p>
     <p>
        For an illustration we take a look at mobile version of most popular e-commerce site H&M <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hm.com/entrance.ahtml?orguri=%2F">H&M</a>
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
    <img id='econimage' src="images/mobile.png">
    </div>
     <p><i>H&M has a beautifully simplified mobile site made up of a consolidated menu and focused homepage content.</i></p>
    </p>
    <h1 id="p3" class="myheading">3. Navigation bars</h1>
    <p>
        The site navigation is usually the main way the customers get around the site and find products. Site navigation can play a major role in capturing or losing a sale. If the customers can’t find your products, they can't purchase them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The navigation bar also need to be responsive when used in a mobile version of the site.Using a popup to display the content is usually most efficient.
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img id='etq' src="images/etq.png">
    </div>
    <p><i>This website navigation example uses a navigation bar at the top of the screen as a highway to the reduced number of categories. The result is that the navigation bar leaves plenty of negative space – even with the expandable menu users see once they hover over the bar</i></p>
    <h1 id="p4" class="myheading">4. Proofs and Customer Reviews</h1>
    <p>
        One of the most important elements of any online store is proof that the product or service is really good. And one of the strongest things that can confirm this is customer reviews. According to Graham Charlton, 61 percent of customers read online reviews before making a purchasing decision. Consumers are more likely to buy things from websites that have reviews and ratings. These sites have real value for people. That’s why online retailers should encourage their customers to leave feedback and share comments.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p5" class="myheading">Concept learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a large promotion or slideshow as the main focus. The majority of the sites i analyzed had a very clear, large main graphic or slideshow as the first element of their homepage. These were typically very eye-catching, set the tone of their brand and also generally promoted some sort of product or category.</li>
        <li>Put products on the homepage. Featuring products on the homepage is a conversion best practice, so it’s no surprise that most of the top 50 ecommerce sites had featured products on their homepages.</li>
        <li>Use a grid layout of categories. In addition to having featured products, a very common element was some sort of grid layout consisting of different blocks of popular categories. These were usually visually enticing and made up of lifestyle or product images to represent the categories they linked to.</li>
      <li>
        Keep the navigation concise and organized. One can clearly tell that the sites analyzed have thought about how their customers shop and organized their categories accordingly
      </li>
      <li>
        Use popout menus for a better user experience. Most of the top 50 ecommerce sites lumped their subcategories into as few main categories as possible and used pop out menus for further exploration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simplify the layout on mobile devices. To accommodate for the smaller screen sizes, many of the top 50 ecommerce sites removed portions of the content that was on the desktop version of their sites. This allows for a more focused, easier shopping experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidate the navigation for mobile devices. It's also very common to see the navigation menus consolidated to a single push or "hamburger" menu. which once pressed, shows more of the content.

      </li>
      
    </ul> 
    <h2 id="p6" class="myheading">My Project</h2>
    <p>
        Based on the ideas ganed from the analysis of some of top e-commerce website.I have made a attempt to build a responsive e-commerce layout
